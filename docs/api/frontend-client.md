# Frontend Client

For the API functions, we use an API client that is type-safe. The generation is provided by the `openapi-typescript` package.

The API client is generated using the OpenAPI schema. The client is generated in the `src/utils/api.ts` file.

The client is a set of functions that make requests to the API. The client is used in the frontend to interact with the API.
