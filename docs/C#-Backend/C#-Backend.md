## Project Documentation: Webstore Backend

### 1. Project Definition
The Webstore Backend project is a server-side application designed to manage the core functionalities of an online store. It provides APIs for user authentication, product management, order processing, and other essential e-commerce operations. This backend interacts with databases, handles business logic, and ensures secure communication with clients.

**Key Features:**
- User authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
- Product catalog management.
- Order creation and tracking.
- Integration with third-party services.
- Secure and scalable architecture.

### 2. Architecture + Technologies
The backend is developed using the following architecture and technologies:

**Architecture:**
- **Layered Architecture**: Separation of concerns with controllers, services, and repositories.
- **RESTful APIs**: Exposes endpoints for client applications to interact with the backend.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized setup for consistent deployment.

**Technologies:**
- **Programming Language**: C# (.NET 6 or higher). [Official Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/)
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core for building APIs. [ASP.NET Core Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/)
- **Database**: Likely SQL-based (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server or PostgreSQL). [Microsoft SQL Server Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/) | [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for secure user sessions. [JWT.io Documentation](https://jwt.io/introduction/)
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in .NET Core DI framework. [Dependency Injection Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection)
- **Configuration Management**: JSON configuration files and environment variables. [Configuration in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/)
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for deployment. [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) | [Docker Compose Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### 3. Use Cases

#### 3.1 User Authentication
- **Scenario**: A user logs in to the application.
- **Flow**:
  1. User provides credentials via a client application.
  2. Backend validates credentials and generates a JWT token.
  3. The token is returned and stored securely on the client side.

#### 3.2 Product Management
- **Scenario**: An admin adds new products to the catalog.
- **Flow**:
  1. Admin sends product details via the API.
  2. Backend validates and stores the product in the database.

#### 3.3 Order Processing
- **Scenario**: A customer places an order.
- **Flow**:
  1. Customer submits the order via the API.
  2. Backend verifies product availability and processes the order.
  3. Order status is updated and confirmation sent to the user.

### 4. Basics of Project Management

**Estimated Timeline:**
- **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering** (1-2 weeks): Define scope, features, and goals.
- **Phase 2: Development** (6-8 weeks): Implement core features and APIs.
- **Phase 3: Testing** (2 weeks): Perform unit, integration, and performance tests.
- **Phase 4: Deployment** (1 week): Deploy to production environment.

**Milestones:**
- Initial API setup and user authentication completed.
- Product management module operational.
- Full order processing workflow integrated.
- Deployment-ready Dockerized application.

### 5. Code Structure

**High-Level Directory Layout:**
```
webstore-backend/
|-- Controllers/           # API controllers handling HTTP requests
|-- Services/              # Business logic implementation
|-- Models/                # Data models and DTOs
|-- Repositories/          # Database interaction layer
|-- Configuration/         # JSON files and environment settings
|-- Infrastructure/        # Dockerfile and deployment scripts
|-- Tests/                 # Unit and integration tests
|-- Webshop.csproj         # .NET project file
```

**Key Components:**
- **Controllers**: Handle API requests and responses.
- **Services**: Contain business logic, including user management, product catalog operations, and order handling.
- **Models**: Define data structures and facilitate data exchange between layers.
- **Repositories**: Abstract database operations, ensuring a clean separation from business logic.
- **Configuration**: Centralized application settings for different environments.
